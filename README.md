# Odin Recipes Project

## Introduction

Odin Recipes is a beginner-friendly project focusing on the essentials of HTML. This project offers a hands-on approach to learning by building a simple recipe website. Only HTML is used, which lays the foundation for understanding web structure before diving into more advanced topics like CSS and JavaScript.

## Features

- Basic **HTML5** structure showcasing `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- Use of headings `<h1>` to `<h6>` to display text in various sizes and importance.
- Organized directory structure for maintaining multiple HTML pages.
- Navigation between an **index page** and **individual recipe pages** using anchor tags `<a href="url">`.
- Embedding images using the `<img src="url" alt="description">` tag.
- Structured content using unordered lists `<ul>` and ordered lists `<ol>` to list ingredients and steps.
- Descriptive paragraphs `<p>` to add context and details to recipes.

## Project Iterations

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure
Created an `index.html` with basic boilerplate and a main heading.

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page
Recipe pages added within a `recipes` directory and linked to the main index.

### Iteration 3: Adding Content
Each recipe page includes a dish image, a description, ingredients, and steps.

### Iteration 4: Expanding the Cookbook
Added more recipes to the collection, ensuring consistent page structure.

By building this project, I have solidified my understanding of:

- The importance of well-structured HTML to lay out web content.
- The functionality of various HTML tags and when to use them.
- Creating a navigable web of pages within a single website.
- Utilizing version control with Git and GitHub for project management.
